# Raspberry Pi Phone Notification Script

This script allows me to send notifications to my phone through the Pushover service whenever an event occurs.
<br>
[Pushover website](https://www.pushover.net)
<br>
<br>
Python3 is required.
<br>
On GNU/Linux, run with "python3 script.py > /dev/null 2>&1 &".
<br>
This redirects stdout to /dev/null and stderr to stdout.
<br>
<br>
To ensure that it's running check with "ps"
